java collection framework

collection of interfaces and classes
framework-contains classes and interfaces
ex:arrays del one value
          insert one value
programer made easy


list collection-sequence
just as array but different
may contain duplicate
add/del any index from list
contains different APIs 

3 kinds of collections

list--arraylist+linkedlist
set--hashset, treeset, linkedHashset implement set interface
hash map

list




set interface
doesnot allow duplicate value
there may be no guarentee that the ele are set in seq
ex:if you added an item in the cart, and again you add the same item in the cart--it save as list
   but, when you applied for a job in dice, you cannot apply another time because it saves as set
 
 
 iterator
 Iterator it=sn.iterator();
 
 .hasnext
 tells us is there any any element after this
 
 Map.Entry mp= <Map.Entry>it.next();
 div the key and ele
 
 difference between hash map and hash set is 
 security- hashtable is secured. does not allow other prog exe on that at same time
