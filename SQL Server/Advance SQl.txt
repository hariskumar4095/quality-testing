CONSTRAINTS:
Constraints are the rules enforced on data coolums of a table this ensure accuracy and reliability of data in database 
Constrainst could be either on a colum level or Table Level
NOT NULL, DEFAULT, PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, CHECK CONSTAINT 

JOINTS:
Inner Join : Inner Joins shows matching data present in bothtables
Left Join :  Gets all data in left table and only matched data from right table 
Right Join : Vice Versa
Full Outer join : all record from both tables 

Union VS Union all :
combine two select statements and display has one record 
union removes duplicate values 
Union performance is very less

INDEXES :
Are special look up tables that database search engine can use to spped up data retrieval. 
indexes are pointer to data in a table.
Speed of indexes for select and where clause queries is high but for DML Comands is very slow 
Indexes can created or dropped with no effect on data 
TYPES OF INDEXES
Single-column Indexes: is created based on only one table Column
CREATE INDEX indexname 

Root node , non leaf nodes and leaf nodes: index
 seek or index scan
on Tablename ( columnname );

Unique Indexes: It does not allow any duplicate values to be inserted into the table
create unique Indexnmae 

Composite Indexes: When an index created on two or more columns of a table
create index indexname
on tablename (column1, column2);

WHEN SHOULD INDEXES BE AVOIDED: 

should not be used on small tables
tables haave insert operatiosn 
coulmns which hae high number of null values
colums which are frequently manipulated should not be indexed

syntax to find the clustered index on a table 
execute sp_helpindex tablename;

An table can have only one clustered index but an clustered index can have morethan 1 columns
Non Clustered index is stored separatly from catual data, a table can have moretha 1 non clustered indexes

clustered indexs are faster than non
clustered index uses less space compared to non cluster.

VIEW : 
A view is nothing but a saved query, vw is a virtual table 

Temp Table:

local temporary table : create table #temptablename are created in tempDB
are present in system databases and check in temporary tables.

to find the temp tbame :
select name from tempdb.sysobjects
where name ='#tempname%'
